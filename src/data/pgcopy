Get however many of these cards you can (given your 5/24 status) in the order most valuable to you. Recommended application rate is 1 new card every 3 months (with extra time between double-dips)***! My suggested app order:
	1.	SW Business OR Ink Preferred 
	2.	(1+ month later) SW Premier and SW Priority** 
	3.	(4+ months later) CSP and CSR* 
	4.	Hyatt**** (or Chase Freedom, if focusing on cashback) 
	5.	United MPE, 50k+ offer only (or Chase Freedom Unlimited, if focusing on cashback)
Check the bonuses for the SW cards - they typically range from 40k-60k. Since you need 110k in the same calendar year for the SW companion pass, you may need also $10k-$30k of MSed or organic spend on the personal cards, or you need to get the SW Biz card instead of (or in addition to) the Ink.

Unless you are 4/24, you can be somewhat flexible in the order you apply for cards!

When under 5/24, you can decide how many Chase biz cards to go after - see box "Notes on Chase Cards" - many have success getting multiple biz cards.

This is where things get even more subjective - essentially, you should start working your way down the list from biggest sign-up bonus to smaller bonuses (while taking into account banks' application rules and sensitivity to inquiries), which is both subjective and an ever-changing target. However, here's a good default list to follow; please tailor to your needs.

To maximize your odds of approval, you'll want to spread applications around among banks over time (except where strategically combining HPs), and respect banks' application rules (Amex's 2/90, Citi's 8/65 and 6/6, Chase's 2/30, BoA's 2/3/4, etc. Check out the guide to banks' anti-churning rules here: http://redd.it/819r08/):
	1.	Barclays Arrival+ (apply immediately after applying for final Chase cards, due to possible 5 or 6/24 rule)
	2.	Barclays AA (possible double-dip with Arrival+, read recent data points on this)
	3.	US Bank Altitude (don't buy gift cards [not even retail GCs] on this card) 
	4.	Citi AA Platinum if under 6 inquiries in past 6 months (6/6 seems to be a soft rule, but it applies to many)
	5.	(8+ days later) CitiBusiness AA if under 6 inquiries in past 6 months and have 5+ yrs of credit history 
	6.	(Barclays, US Bank, and Citi are usually more inquiry sensitive than other banks on this list - the order of the cards below this line is more flexible)
	7.	Targeted 100k Amex personal platinum offer (if you have no Amex cards at the moment) 
	8.	Some Citi TY card if under 6 inquiries in past 6 months - hold out for a 50k+ TY point bonus 
	9.	A BoA app-o-rama - Premium Rewards, Alaska Biz, and one of the Alaska Pers.,  Asiana, or Virgin Atlantic 
	10.	CNB Crystal Visa (bonus disappears and reappears - get it when the bonus is 50k+) 
	11.	Amex SPG Luxury (if sign-up bonus is still points - combine with 1 or more charge card applications) 
	12.	Amex SPG Biz (combine with 1 or more charge card applications) 
	13.	Amex SPG Personal (combine with 1 or more charge card applications)
	14.	The Amex charge cards - PRG, BRG, Biz Plat, 25k Green, etc. (and personal Plat, if no 100k offer for you) 
	15.	Amex Delta and Hilton cards - combine w/ charge apps 
	16.	Capital One Venture 
	17.	US Bank FlexPerks (when the Olympic promo is going on) 
	18.	Other cards - Club Carlson, Wyndham, etc.
Specialty card: if you travel a lot for work, can book your own hotel, pay for it with your own card, get reimbursed, and have a lot of paid hotel stays of 4+ nights, get the Citi PrestigeASAP - the 4th night benefit will be more valuable to you than any other single card.

Best travel cards for ongoing/unbonused spend - pick your favorite currency:
	1. For MRs: Amex Blue Biz Plus
	2. For URs: Chase Freedom Unlimited (get by PCing CSP or CSR) or Chase Ink Unlimited

For cashback sign-up bonuses:
	1.	Arrival+ and Capital One Venture (they are "travel" cards, but there are ways to redeem the bonuses essentially for cash) 
	2.	Capital One Spark (6 months after Venture) 
	3.	Wells Fargo Business Platinum (be sure to pick the cash back option in app for the $500 bonus)
	4.	Wells Fargo Propel World (avail. via phone app ONLY - call 1-800-932-6736) 
	5.	US Bank Altitude 
	6.	BoA cards - Premium Rewards and cards with $200+ cashback bonuses  - apply for 2 pers. and 1 biz in one day)
	7.	CNB Crystal Visa (bonus disappears and reappears - get it when the bonus is 50k+) 
	8.	Amex MR cards (start with a targeted 100k personal Plat) - with a Schwab Platinum, MRs can be redeemed to a Schwab account for 1.25 cents each 
	9.	Amex BCP 
For ongoing cashback earning (you'll probably want to grab several/most of these so you can be earning 3-5% on as much of your spending as possible):
	1.	Amex BCP or BCE 
	2.	Discover It 
	3.	Chase Freedom (PC a CSP or CSR to this) 
	4.	US Bank Cash+ 
	5.	Discover it Miles (1st year only)
	6.	Alliant Visa Signature 
	7.	Fidelity 2% Visa or Citi DoubleCash (DC only worth it if it's a PC from a Citi TY Premier or AA with a 50k+ sign-up bonus) 
	8.	Citi Costco Visa (only worth it if it's a PC from a TY Premier or AA with a 50k+ sign-up bonus) 
	9.	Uber credit card
	10.	Wells Fargo Rewards (5X on $12.5k in gas, grocery, and drugstore for first 6 months) 
	11.	Ink Cash
	12.	Vantage West Connect Visa (choose your 5x)
